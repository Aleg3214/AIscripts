# STM32 model zoo notebooks

This directory contains notebook examples to run STM32 model zoo. These notebooks should be downloaded, then uploaded **Jupyter** or **Colab**.

* [STM32AI_Model_Zoo_Colab.ipynb](./STM32AI_Model_Zoo_Colab.ipynb) shows how to train an image classification model on a custom or public dataset using our [scripts](../../image_classification/scripts/training/README.md).
* [STM32CubeAI_DevCloud.ipynb](./STM32CubeAI_DevCloud.ipynb) shows how to access to the STM32Cube.AI Developer Cloud through ST Python APIs (based on REST API) instead of using the web application *https://stm32ai-cs.st.com*.
